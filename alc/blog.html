            <div>1/30/26: This episode had some genuine works of art. Seeing the action happen in the way it is presented really illustrated Emmy's feelings about what is going on. With the slower pace of the last few episodes, this episode starts to move things along again and I found it funny how a "nice guy" gets his just desserts. Enjoy</div>
            <div>1/23/26: Meanwhile, this episode focuses on another perspective. The contrast in character between the men in the plot is on full display here. You'll notice it's not really about good versus evil, it's just a difference between the two of them. I hope you enjoy this alternative perspective this week.</div>
            <div>1/16/26: A little late with this one. Took a three day vacation this past weekend. Woke up in some else's house, ate breakfast, rode in a car with friend, and eventually made it home. Almost like some sort of metaphor that relates directly to the episode. This week's episode is an easy read.</div>
            <div>1/9/26: Aftermath. That word describes this episode well. This kind of situation needs to be unwound and I appreciate how things slow down. The conversations are engaging and I was eager to see how things unfolded. There are also some calm moments in this episode that helped me relax with the direction the story is taking. The facial expressions made me smile as well. A good read, I hope you like it too.</div>
            <div>1/2/26: This week might have some forward content where the art draws your eyes; never the less this was a good one. After the previous episode that was full of movement and story beats. This episode begins the process of slowing down the plot so the reader and the characters can catch up. With so much going on, this sort of episode is necessary to tie loose ends before continueing with the rest of the plot. Enjoy!</div>
